The travel agency information can also be obtained through this application.

Key Features:
Dynamic User Interface:

The application boasts a dynamic and modern user interface crafted using the Swing framework, a powerful toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces in Java applications.
Header Section:

The header section prominently displays the title "Admin Control Center" alongside the name of the Travel and Tourism Management System.
An administrator icon adds a personal touch to the dashboard.
Navigation Panel:

The left-side navigation panel offers quick access to essential functionalities.
Buttons include "Customers Details," "Booked Packages," "Hotels Details," "Booked Hotels," and "Close Software."
Main Content Area:

The main content area showcases an appealing image related to travel and tourism, setting the tone for the application.
Interactive Buttons:

Each navigation button is designed for interactivity, changing color on mouse hover to enhance the user experience.
Technical Concepts:
Swing Framework:

The graphical user interface is built using the Swing framework, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
Event Handling:

Event handling is implemented through the ActionListener interface. Buttons in the navigation panel respond to user interactions, triggering actions associated with each button.
Multi-Window Architecture:

The application utilizes multiple JFrame instances to implement a multi-window architecture. Each functionality, such as customer details, booked packages, and hotels information, is presented in a separate window.
Dynamic Layout Management:

Layouts such as null layout and border layout are used to dynamically manage the positioning of components within the JFrame. This ensures a responsive and organized display.
Image Rendering:

Icons and background images are rendered using Java's Image class. The images are scaled to fit the desired dimensions using the Image.SCALE_DEFAULT property.
ActionListener Implementation:

Buttons are equipped with ActionListener implementations. The actionPerformed method is overridden to specify the actions to be performed when a button is clicked.
Conditional Logic:

Conditional logic, such as confirming the closure of the software, is implemented using standard Java if statements. The JOptionPane class is utilized for displaying confirmation dialogs.
System Exit Mechanism:

The System.exit(0) method is employed to gracefully close the software. This ensures that the application terminates cleanly when the administrator confirms the software closure.
Usage:
Launching the Admin Application:

The application launches in full-screen mode, offering an encompassing view of the travel and tourism management functionalities.
Navigating Through Options:

Administrators effortlessly navigate through various functionalities by clicking the respective buttons on the intuitive navigation panel.
Accessing Detailed Information:

Clicking on each button opens a new window, providing administrators with detailed insights into customer data, booked packages, hotels, and booked hotels.
Closing the Software:

Administrators can opt to gracefully close the software by clicking the "Close Software" button, triggering a confirmation dialog for user convenience.
